### Ejecutando en dispositivo fisico
In these two operating systems it is not possible to share your USB device with the container, that is why we must resort to an alternative way.

First you will have to have the platforms tools that contain ADB installed on your host machine and you can download them here

Connect your device via USB and make sure debugging is enabled, then run in your host machine:
adb tcpip 5555
Find the IP address of your device, go to Settings > Wi-Fi > Advanced > IP Address on your device or run adb shell netcfg.
Connect to device using the IP address with the following command:
adb connect xxx.xxx.x.x
Disconnect USB and proceed to open the dev container in vscode.
Now inside your container run the command from step 3 with the same IP address.
Verify if the container can list now your device using adb devices.
